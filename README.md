# Model-Control-RCV

This is a repo for course project of [EL2425 Automatic Control, Project Course](https://www.kth.se/social/course/EL2425/) at KTH. 

This repo includes two lines of work, namely the RCV simulator and the RCV test run. For the simulator work, we modified an open-source simulator [*car_demo*](https://github.com/osrf/car_demo) to make it compatible with the RCV. You can find it [here](https://github.com/txzhao/car_demo); For the RCV test run, we prepared two sets of configurations.
